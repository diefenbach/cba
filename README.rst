    CBA is alpha with all well known consequences.

What is it?
===========

CBA is a framework to create web applications based on components. Components
are buttons, input fields, links, etc.

Overview
========

- An application based on CBA is completely build with components provided by
  CBA.
- All components and their values are accessible during run time.
- All components can be changed and refreshed separately.
- The whole application can be build with ``Python`` only (but don't have to.
  Own CSS and Javascript can be provided as well).
- CBA comes with a set of core components, see the API documentation for more.
  Own components can be added easily.
- CBA is build on top of ``Django``, which means, all ``Django`` features are
  available, e.g. the ORM, the authentication system or the i18n framework.
- CBA is inspired by EPFL http://pyramid-epfl.readthedocs.io/.
